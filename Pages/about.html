            Hi my name is Kamaljit Singh Bhullar. I am currently residing in surrey, BC. I <strong>love</strong> video games <em>a lot</em>.
            I have some understanding of html due to the fact that i have done some in highschool. But I mean almost everyone has and its been years
            so i have almost forgot most of it. I do have background on the <em>hardware side</em> of IT.
